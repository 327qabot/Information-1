In this assignment, you will combine your Front End and Back Office into a complete day-to-day system through simulation.

1. You will create a “Daily” script or driver program that 
   - runs your Front End over a number of trainsactions (of your choice) for different locations, resulting different transaction files.
   - runs your Back End program that merges transaction and produce new information files. 
   - [you can simply pip a file as input to the program for a location]
   
2. Once you have your Daily script working, you are to write a “Weekly” script that 
   - runs the Daily script five separate times, simulating five days of operation. (Doesn't banking happen on weekends too?  It does now, but it didn't in the old days.)  
   - The Weekly script should run a different set of transaction sessions for each of the five days of operation. 
   - Begin your Weekly run with an empty acount/ticket information file, and have the first day’s transaction sessions begin by creating some accounts and tickets.
   - copy/save the daily produced files seperately per day.
     
3. Integration failure report:
   - Like previous testing assignemnts, document bugs encountered and fixes applied. 


#### Deliveries & Marking:


1. Integration Defect Report 

- Teamwork (PR practice, build-passing, review, etc.) 2
- Daily script - Correctly implements spec above and clearly show the inputs of different locations to the program.
- Weekly script - Correctly implements spec above and clearly show the inputs of different days.
- Daily acount/Ticket information files are in the correct format.
